          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is <b>case sensitive</b>, letters include the
          characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through
          "z" (lowercase).
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
            curly brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
